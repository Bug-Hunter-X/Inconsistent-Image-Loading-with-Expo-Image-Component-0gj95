This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that points to an image hosted on a remote server.  The image fails to load and the `onError` callback is not triggered, leaving the user with a blank space where the image should be.  This is especially problematic when dealing with dynamic image URLs that may occasionally be unavailable. The issue appears inconsistent; sometimes the image loads fine, but other times it simply doesn't, without any clear error message.
