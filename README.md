# Inconsistent Image Loading with Expo Image Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo `Image` component intermittently fails to load remote images.  The issue is characterized by the lack of error reporting; the image simply doesn't appear, and the `onError` callback is not triggered.  This makes debugging and implementing robust error handling difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe that the image sometimes loads correctly, while other times it fails to load without any indication of an error.

## Potential Causes

* Network issues: Intermittent connectivity problems might be a contributing factor.
* Server-side issues: The remote server hosting the image may experience temporary outages or errors.
* Expo Image component limitations:  There might be edge cases or limitations in the Expo `Image` component that are not properly handled.

## Proposed Solution

The solution involves implementing a retry mechanism and more comprehensive error handling using the `onError` callback and potentially a state management system for managing loading states.
